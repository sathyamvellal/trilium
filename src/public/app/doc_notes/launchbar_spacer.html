<p>Spacer allows you to visually group launchers. You can configure it in the promoted attributes:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>baseSize</code> - defines size in pixels (if there's enough space)</li>
    <li><code>growthFactor</code> - set to 0 if you want the spacer to be of constant <code>baseSize</code>, with positive value it will grow.</li>
</ul>
